# The-Sequential-Budgeted-Portfolio-Optimization-Problem

This repository contains the code related to the work 'The sequential budgeted portfolio optimization problem on online social platforms'

In this notebook we evaluate the performance of our models introduced in our manuscript. First, we introduce synthetic networks to analyze the impact of graph structure on the campaign. We discuss and compare our low-complexity fast algorithm and the rule of thumb against alternative algorithms from the literature to analyze their comparative advantage for the specific budgeted portfolio optimization problem. Furthermore, we argue how Nano-, Micro-, and Macro-influencers differ in each of the various graph structure across different algorithms. We numerically investigate the impact of each type of influencers on the different types of networks. Subsequently, we use a real large Twitter database to evaluate the performance of our low-complexity fast algorithm based on Frank-Wolfe, for various campaign objectives. Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the multi-platform model introduced to analyze the potential ROI-ratio resulting from an optimal budget allocation between networks, one synthetic and the real Twitter data trace. To carry out our evaluations, in such analysis we implement a sparse version of the social influencer selection by the push method for the particular case of Î±-fairness utility functions.
